Review the insurance.csv file to understand if there are missing information for observations along with abnormalities in the attributes of the table.\n2. Import the insurance.csv file into the Python IDE environment for staging, extractions, data manipulations and presentation.\n3. Create lists and import the insurance.csv data based on the attribute column names for brevity and organizational sake.\n4. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis to understand aspects of the cleaned medical data set into the dicitonary lists using various tools like loops, comprehension lists, and functions.\n5.
